Hello, and thank you for opening this document.

Unfortunately, there was some obstacles completing everything I wanted to implement in this program, but I have created several buttons and windows that can be used to see the interface that could have been.

To go to the "Exercise" Window, click on the picture above the Exercise Label.

To go to the "Diet" Window, click on the picture above the Diet Label.

To Exit the program, click on the Exit button located in the top left corner, accessible on all three windows.
